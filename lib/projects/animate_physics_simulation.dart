// Physics simulations, making the app interactions to feel realistic and interactive. Eg animating a widget to act as if it were attached to a spring or falling with gravity. 

// USING THE STEPS BELOW TO DEMOSTRATES HOW TO MOVE A WIDGET FROM A DRAGGED POINT BACK TO THE CENTER USING A SPRING SIMULATION. 
//1. Set up an animation controller  2. Move the widget using gestures  3. Animate the widet   4. Calculate the velocity to simulate a sprining motion.
